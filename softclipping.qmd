Plotted using R and tidyverse packages [@Wickham2019-ot]. Note that the smiley plot above is not the 'typical' PyDamage output, however it is a simplified version of the 'C to T transitions' line in PyDamage plots represented here for illustrative purposes.

This smiley plot can often be seen when using certain short-read mapping settings.
In particular researchers using the aligner `bowtie2` with one of the `local` modes will often see 0% damage on the first couple of positions from the end of the read, but then the subsequent frequencies along the remainder of the read will have a 'typical' damage pattern curve.

When in `local` mode, the aligner will allow 'soft-clipping'. 
Soft-clipping is where the aligner finds that the inner-portion of the read maps optimally to the reference, except for the ends of the reads.
In soft-clipping, the aligner will 'ignore' the ends of the reads and not use this information in the final alignment however retain those nucleotides in the alignment file (as opposed to hard-clipping which removes these bases entirely and are 'lost' to downstream processes). This is commonly performed in modern DNA studies as retaining ends of the reads are not important compared to getting a highly accurate alignment overall.

For example, the aligner may clip off read ends that have damage because it is alignment-wise better than having three consecutive bases that have damage.

In such cases, a researcher can try to use the `global` alignment mode in such such aligners (e.g. with `--sensitive` rather than `--sensitive-local` in `bowtie2`). Otherwise, if the pattern is sufficiently strong (and the alignments are trusted), a researcher can still use the plot and data as long as the pattern of the missing first few bases is described.
