This repository contains a examples of different types of ancient DNA damage plots, both valid and invalid, and describes the causes behind them.

To add a new plot, add a new `.qmd` markdown file, and add the name of the file to the corresponding 'part' in `_quarto.yml`. Raw deamination plot data file for the corresponding plot should be added to the `assets/data` folder with the same name as a the `.qmd` file. Caricature image should go in `assets/images` also with the same name as the `.qmd`.
