## How to generate damage patterns

There is a range of software that can generate damage pattern plots from ancient DNA NGS libraries. The vast majority of tools require to be of sequencing reads aligned to a reference genome. Here we make suggestions of some tools that you can use to generate such plots.

### Genomics

These tools general take BAM files as input (i.e., after mapping of FASTQ files to a reference genome using a short-read aligner )
