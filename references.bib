  abstract = "High-throughput direct sequencing techniques have recently opened
              the possibility to sequence genomes from Pleistocene organisms.
              Here we analyze DNA sequences determined from a Neandertal, a
              mammoth, and a cave bear. We show that purines are overrepresented
              at positions adjacent to the breaks in the ancient DNA, suggesting
              that depurination has contributed to its degradation. We
              furthermore show that substitutions resulting from miscoding
              cytosine residues are vastly overrepresented in the DNA sequences
              and drastically clustered in the ends of the molecules, whereas
              other substitutions are rare. We present a model where the
              observed substitution patterns are used to estimate the rate of
              deamination of cytosine residues in single- and double-stranded
              portions of the DNA, the length of single-stranded ends, and the
              frequency of nicks. The results suggest that reliable genome
              sequences can be obtained from Pleistocene organisms.",
