              the possibility to sequence genomes from Pleistocene organisms.
              Here we analyze DNA sequences determined from a Neandertal, a
              mammoth, and a cave bear. We show that purines are overrepresented
              at positions adjacent to the breaks in the ancient DNA, suggesting
              that depurination has contributed to its degradation. We
              furthermore show that substitutions resulting from miscoding
              cytosine residues are vastly overrepresented in the DNA sequences
              and drastically clustered in the ends of the molecules, whereas
              other substitutions are rare. We present a model where the
              observed substitution patterns are used to estimate the rate of
              deamination of cytosine residues in single- and double-stranded
              portions of the DNA, the length of single-stranded ends, and the
              frequency of nicks. The results suggest that reliable genome
              sequences can be obtained from Pleistocene organisms.",

  abstract = "Motivation: Ancient DNA (aDNA) molecules in fossilized bones and
              teeth, coprolites, sediments, mummified specimens and museum
              collections represent fantastic sources of information for
              evolutionary biologists, revealing the agents of past epidemics
              and the dynamics of past populations. However, the analysis of
              aDNA generally faces two major issues. Firstly, sequences consist
              of a mixture of endogenous and various exogenous backgrounds,
              mostly microbial. Secondly, high nucleotide misincorporation rates
              can be observed as a result of severe post-mortem DNA damage. Such
              misincorporation patterns are instrumental to authenticate ancient
              sequences versus modern contaminants. We recently developed the
              user-friendly mapDamage package that identifies such patterns from
              next-generation sequencing (NGS) sequence datasets. The absence of
              formal statistical modeling of the DNA damage process, however,
              precluded rigorous quantitative comparisons across
              samples.Results: Here, we describe mapDamage 2.0 that extends the
              original features of mapDamage by incorporating a statistical
              model of DNA damage. Assuming that damage events depend only on
              sequencing position and post-mortem deamination, our Bayesian
              statistical framework provides estimates of four key features of
              aDNA molecules: the average length of overhangs (λ), nick
              frequency (ν) and cytosine deamination rates in both
              double-stranded regions () and overhangs (). Our model enables
              rescaling base quality scores according to their probability of
              being damaged. mapDamage 2.0 handles NGS datasets with ease and is
              compatible with a wide range of DNA library
              protocols.Availability: mapDamage 2.0 is available at
              ginolhac.github.io/mapDamage/ as a Python package and

               ancient samples based on specific features remains a crucial step
               in data analysis. Because of this central importance, researchers
               lacking deeper programming knowledge should be able to run a
               basic damage authentication analysis. Such software should be
               user-friendly and easy to integrate into an analysis pipeline.
               RESULTS: DamageProfiler is a Java based, stand-alone software to
               determine damage patterns in ancient DNA. The results are
               provided in various file formats and plots for further
               processing. DamageProfiler has an intuitive graphical as well as
               command line interface that allows the tool to be easily embedded
               into an analysis pipeline. AVAILABILITY: All of the source code

              long-distance transport of natural resources is essential for
              determining the impacts of past human activities on marine
              environments. However, the specific biological sources of imported
              fauna are often difficult to identify, in particular if species
              have a wide spatial distribution and lack clear osteological or
              isotopic differentiation between populations. Here, we report that
              ancient fish-bone remains, despite being porous, brittle, and
              light, provide an excellent source of endogenous DNA (15-46\%) of
              sufficient quality for whole-genome reconstruction. By comparing
              ancient sequence data to that of modern specimens, we determine
              the biological origin of 15 Viking Age (800-1066 CE) and
              subsequent medieval (1066-1280 CE) Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua)
              specimens from excavation sites in Germany, Norway, and the United
              Kingdom. Archaeological context indicates that one of these sites
              was a fishing settlement for the procurement of local catches,
              whereas the other localities were centers of trade. Fish from the
              trade sites show a mixed ancestry and are statistically
              differentiated from local fish populations. Moreover, Viking Age
              samples from Haithabu, Germany, are traced back to the North East
              Arctic Atlantic cod population that has supported the Lofoten
              fisheries of Norway for centuries. Our results resolve a
              long-standing controversial hypothesis and indicate that the
              marine resources of the North Atlantic Ocean were used to sustain
              an international demand for protein as far back as the Viking Age.",
