              Here we analyze DNA sequences determined from a Neandertal, a
              mammoth, and a cave bear. We show that purines are overrepresented
              at positions adjacent to the breaks in the ancient DNA, suggesting
              that depurination has contributed to its degradation. We
              furthermore show that substitutions resulting from miscoding
              cytosine residues are vastly overrepresented in the DNA sequences
              and drastically clustered in the ends of the molecules, whereas
              other substitutions are rare. We present a model where the
              observed substitution patterns are used to estimate the rate of
              deamination of cytosine residues in single- and double-stranded
              portions of the DNA, the length of single-stranded ends, and the

              teeth, coprolites, sediments, mummified specimens and museum
              collections represent fantastic sources of information for
              evolutionary biologists, revealing the agents of past epidemics
              and the dynamics of past populations. However, the analysis of
              aDNA generally faces two major issues. Firstly, sequences consist
              of a mixture of endogenous and various exogenous backgrounds,
              mostly microbial. Secondly, high nucleotide misincorporation rates
              can be observed as a result of severe post-mortem DNA damage. Such
              misincorporation patterns are instrumental to authenticate ancient
              sequences versus modern contaminants. We recently developed the
              user-friendly mapDamage package that identifies such patterns from
              next-generation sequencing (NGS) sequence datasets. The absence of
              formal statistical modeling of the DNA damage process, however,
              precluded rigorous quantitative comparisons across
              samples.Results: Here, we describe mapDamage 2.0 that extends the
              original features of mapDamage by incorporating a statistical
              model of DNA damage. Assuming that damage events depend only on
              sequencing position and post-mortem deamination, our Bayesian
              statistical framework provides estimates of four key features of
              aDNA molecules: the average length of overhangs (λ), nick
              frequency (ν) and cytosine deamination rates in both
              double-stranded regions () and overhangs (). Our model enables
              rescaling base quality scores according to their probability of
              being damaged. mapDamage 2.0 handles NGS datasets with ease and is
              compatible with a wide range of DNA library

              concentrations which makes it highly prone to contamination by
              modern sources. Strict precautions are therefore necessary to
              ensure that DNA from modern sources does not appear in the final

              widely applied authenticity for ancient DNA studies is to test for
              elevated deaminated cytosine residues towards the termini of the
              molecules: DNA damage. To date, this has primarily been used for
              single organisms and recently for read assemblies, however, these
              methods are not applicable for estimating DNA damage for ancient
              metagenomes with tens and even hundreds of thousands of
              species.MethodsWe presentmetaDMG, a novel framework and toolkit
              that allows for the estimation, quantification and visualization
              of postmortem damage for single reads, single genomes and even
              metagenomic environmental DNA by utilizing the taxonomic branching
              structure. It bypasses any need for initial classification,
              splitting reads by individual organisms, and realignment. We have
              implemented a Bayesian approach that combines a modified geometric
              damage profile with a beta-binomial model to fit the entire model
              to the individual misincorporations at all taxonomic
              levels.ResultsWe evaluated the performance using both simulated

              methods when relevant. We findmetaDMGto be an order of magnitude
              faster than previous methods and more accurate – even for complex
              metagenomes. Our simulations show thatmetaDMGcan estimate DNA
              damage at taxonomic levels down to 100 reads, that the estimated
              uncertainties decrease with increased number of reads and that the

               ancient samples are often burdened with environmental
               contamination, resulting in metagenomic datasets that represent
               mixtures of ancient and modern DNA. The ability to rapidly and
               reliably establish the authenticity and integrity of ancient
               samples is essential for ancient DNA studies, and the ability to
               distinguish between ancient and modern sequences is particularly
               important for ancient microbiome studies. Characteristic patterns
               of ancient DNA damage, namely DNA fragmentation and cytosine
               deamination (observed as C-to-T transitions) are typically used
               to authenticate ancient samples and sequences, but existing tools
               for inspecting and filtering aDNA damage either compute it at the
               read level, which leads to high data loss and lower quality when
               used in combination with de novo assembly, or require manual
               inspection, which is impractical for ancient assemblies that
               typically contain tens to hundreds of thousands of contigs. To

               on both on simulated aDNA data and archaeological paleofeces, and
               we demonstrate its ability to reliably and automatically identify
               contigs bearing DNA damage characteristic of aDNA. Coupled with

              reagents. However, DNA fragments isolated from ancient specimens
              show a characteristic DNA damage pattern caused by miscoding
              lesions that differs from present day DNA sequences. Here, we
              develop a framework for evaluating the likelihood of a sequence
              originating from a model with postmortem degradation-summarized in
              a postmortem degradation score-which allows the identification of
              DNA fragments that are unlikely to originate from present day
              sources. We apply this approach to a contaminated Neandertal
              specimen from Okladnikov Cave in Siberia to isolate its endogenous
              DNA from modern human contaminants and show that the reconstructed
              mitochondrial genome sequence is more closely related to the
              variation of Western Neandertals than what was discernible from
              previous analyses. Our method opens up the potential for genomic
              analysis of contaminated fossil material.",

              sequencing technologies often allows multiple samples to be
              sequenced in parallel on a single sequencing run. This is
              particularly true if subsets of the genome are studied rather than
              complete genomes. In recent years, target capture from sequencing
              libraries has largely replaced polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as
              the preferred method of target enrichment. Parallelizing target
              capture and sequencing for multiple samples requires the
              incorporation of sample-specific barcodes into sequencing
              libraries, which is necessary to trace back the sample source of
              each sequence. This protocol describes a fast and reliable method
              for the preparation of barcoded (``indexed'') sequencing libraries
              for Illumina's Genome Analyzer platform. The protocol avoids
              expensive commercial library preparation kits and can be performed
              in a 96-well plate setup using multi-channel pipettes, requiring
              not more than two or three days of lab work. Libraries can be

               outbreaks throughout human history, and ancient DNA evidence has
               shown it afflicted human populations as far back as the
               Neolithic. Y. pestis genomes recovered from the Eurasian Late
               Neolithic/Early Bronze Age (LNBA) period have uncovered key
               evolutionary steps that led to its emergence from a Yersinia
               pseudotuberculosis-like progenitor; however, the number of
               reconstructed LNBA genomes are too few to explore its diversity
               during this critical period of development. Here, we present 17
               Y. pestis genomes dating to 5,000 to 2,500 y BP from a wide
               geographic expanse across Eurasia. This increased dataset enabled
               us to explore correlations between temporal, geographical, and
               genetic distance. Our results suggest a nonflea-adapted and
               potentially extinct single lineage that persisted over millennia
               without significant parallel diversification, accompanied by
               rapid dispersal across continents throughout this period, a trend
               not observed in other pathogens for which ancient genomes are
               available. A stepwise pattern of gene loss provides further clues
               on its early evolution and potential adaptation. We also discover
               the presence of the flea-adapted form of Y. pestis in Bronze Age
               Iberia, previously only identified in in the Caucasus and the
               Volga regions, suggesting a much wider geographic spread of this
               form of Y. pestis. Together, these data reveal the dynamic nature

              DNA usually involves ligation of adapters to double-stranded DNA
              fragments. However, for highly degraded DNA, especially ancient
              DNA, library preparation has been found to be more efficient if
              each of the two DNA strands are converted into library molecules
              separately. We present a new method for single-stranded library
              preparation, ssDNA2.0, which is based on single-stranded DNA
              ligation with T4 DNA ligase utilizing a splinter oligonucleotide
              with a stretch of random bases hybridized to a 3΄ biotinylated
              donor oligonucleotide. A thorough evaluation of this ligation
              scheme shows that single-stranded DNA can be ligated to adapter
              oligonucleotides in higher concentration than with CircLigase (an
              RNA ligase that was previously chosen for end-to-end ligation in
              single-stranded library preparation) and that biases in ligation
              can be minimized when choosing splinters with 7 or 8 random
              nucleotides. We show that ssDNA2.0 tolerates higher quantities of
              input DNA than CircLigase-based library preparation, is less
              costly and better compatible with automation. We also provide an
              in-depth comparison of library preparation methods on degraded DNA
              from various sources. Most strikingly, we find that
              single-stranded library preparation increases library yields from

              associated with wild rodents and their fleas. Historically it was
              responsible for three pandemics: the Plague of Justinian in the
              6th century AD, which persisted until the 8th century [1]; the
              renowned Black Death of the 14th century [2, 3], with recurrent
              outbreaks until the 18th century [4]; and the most recent 19th
              century pandemic, in which Y. pestis spread worldwide [5] and
              became endemic in several regions [6]. The discovery of molecular
              signatures of Y. pestis in prehistoric Eurasian individuals and
              two genomes from Southern Siberia suggest that Y. pestis caused
              some form of disease in humans prior to the first historically

              pestis genomes spanning the Late Neolithic to the Bronze Age

              social changes that led to cross-European networks of contact and
              exchange [8, 9]. We show that all known LNBA strains form a single
              putatively extinct clade in the Y. pestis phylogeny. Interpreting
              our data within the context of recent ancient human genomic
              evidence that suggests an increase in human mobility during the
              LNBA, we propose a possible scenario for the early spread of Y.
