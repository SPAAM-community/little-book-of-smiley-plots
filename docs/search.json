    "text": "Preface\nA key part of any ancient DNA project is to show that the DNA is exactly that - that the DNA is ancient, rather than from modern contamination.\nA key authentication method is to show the presence of elevated C to T deamination patterns (and the complementary G to A) at the end of DNA molecules - known as damage patterns - originally reported by (Briggs et al. 2007).\nThese patterns can be plotted in what have been colloquially known as ’Smiley Plots. However, there can be a wide range of smiley plots, some which show valid ancient DNA, and others that do not - either due to not actually having true ancient DNA but also from laboratory and/or bioinformatic artifacts.\nThis book aims to act as a reference guide to interpreting ancient DNA damage plots, providing a wide range of example ‘smiley plots’, with descriptions of what the describe and what can cause them. As an added bit of fun, each type of ‘smiley plot’ comes with a artistic interpretation of the line shape contributed by members of the ancient DNA community.\n\n\n\n\nBriggs, Adrian W, Udo Stenzel, Philip L F Johnson, Richard E Green, Janet Kelso, Kay Prüfer, Matthias Meyer, et al. 2007. “Patterns of Damage in Genomic DNA Sequences from a Neandertal.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 104 (37): 14616–21. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0704665104."

    "text": "What are damage patterns\nDamage patterns on ancient DNA molecules occur due to increased miscoding lesions at the end of molecules. When DNA molecules start to decompose (i.e., repair mechanisms are lost once an organism dies), the very long DNA molecules start to fragment due to ‘nicks’ occurring on the sugar-phosphate of one of the strands, weakening the structure and causing the molecule to cleave into two. However, this cleavage is not necessarily ‘clean’, i.e., occurs on both strands at the same position. Rather, when the two uneven ‘nicks’ cause the DNA molecule to cleave into two, this results in a ‘jagged’ break - with the molecules having ‘overhangs’ of one strand being longer than the other of each of the new two now-‘independent’ molecules.\nThe resulting single-stranded overhangs leave the nitrogenous-bases ‘exposed’ on the overhang to the surrounding environment. In such cases, of the four nucleotides, it was found that cytosines undergo deamination at a higher rate than the others via hydrolysis. The loss of a cytosines amine group results in a nucleotide structure normally found more often in RNA molecules - uracils. The reason why palaeogenomicists report ‘C to T’ damage patterns is because some polymerases will misread uracils as an adenine, and will incorporate a thymine on the opposite strand during DNA amplification. During each subsequent amplification cycle, the mis-incorporated T will propagate across the subsequent copies of the original DNA molecule.\nTo summarise, the unequal ends of fragmented DNA molecules results in the increased chance of damage to the nucleotides to the overhangs. This structural damage occurs more frequently in cytosines over the other bases, however these ‘damaged’ cytosines are misread by polymerases during DNA amplification to result on thymines on the opposite strand (rather than the expected complementary guanines).\nIt is important to note that the library construction method will influence damage, e.g., is the library constructed from double-stranded DNA or single-stranded DNA, is the polymerase in the initial library amplification proof-reading or not, and so on. Throughout the rest of this book, each damage pattern will be described in the context of the library construction method of the data used to generate each damage pattern.\nThe increased frequency to C to T was detected at the end of molecules could only be detected with the invention of ‘Next Generation Sequencing’ or ‘NGS’ (Shendure and Ji 2008). NGS allowed palaeogenomicists to easily sequence thousands to millions of DNA molecules in one go in an untargeted manner, which subsequently meant that molecules from across entire genomes could be compared against a reference genome. Bioinformaticially, the increase of C to T miscoding lesions were detected by measuring the frequency of mutations at each position across each read, where each read was derived from a different place on the reference genome. As many different places across the reference genome would have different base composition, one would expect to see an approximately random distribution of mutations across the genome. However it was observed in Neanderthals DNA libraries that the frequency of C to T mutation in the first ~10 base pairs of the 5p end of double-stranded library molecules had a higher frequency than the expected approximate equal distribution across each type of mutation, as seen in Figure 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: First reported misincorporation lesion ‘smiley plot’ from Neanderthal DNA (Briggs et al. 2007).

Overhangs at the other end of the molecule (which may also hold cytosine demination) are ‘blunt-ended’ by being trimmed off. Both fill-in and blunt-ending reactions are performed to allow ligation of next-generation-sequencing adapters and/or internal barcodes to both ends of the molecules.

UDG or USER Treatment consists of enzymatically cleaving off ends of molecules when a uracil is present. Whereas complete-UDG UDG full runs the protocol long enough for all DNA molecules to be enzymatically modified, partial UDG stops early, meaning that a small number of reads retain uracils on the last base.

This was observed in Brealey et al. (2020), who associated this to the explanation of reduced ligation efficiency to DNA molecules of internal barcode with a terminal G or C (i.e., short synthetic oligos with known sequences added directly prior addition of library adapters and indices) as suggested by Rohland et al. (2015).\nIn other words, certain internal barcode sequences with a terminal G or C do not ligate as as well to an ancient DNA molecule with a deaminated C on the terminus, and thus those read will be lost during the second round of demultiplexing as it will not contain the barcode associated with that library.\nUltimately you should not be too worried about this plot if you get it - you probably still have aligned true aDNA reads, however you may have lost a small fraction of true ancient DNA reads in that particular library. If you wish to ensure you have retained as many aDNA reads as possible, you should re-build the library from an extract but with different internal barcodes without a terminal G or C.\n\n\n\n\nBrealey, Jaelle C, Henrique G Leitão, Tom van der Valk, Wenbo Xu, Katia Bougiouri, Love Dalén, and Katerina Guschanski. 2020. “Dental Calculus as a Tool to Study the Evolution of the Mammalian Oral Microbiome.” Molecular Biology and Evolution 37 (10): 3003–22. https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa135.\n\n\nRohland, Nadin, Eadaoin Harney, Swapan Mallick, Susanne Nordenfelt, and David Reich. 2015. “Partial Uracil-DNA-Glycosylase Treatment for Screening of Ancient DNA.” Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

However the rest of line and also the 3p show random spikes making it very difficult to make any firm conclusion.\nWhen you receive a plot like this, you normally need to increase the number of reads in your alignment against the reference genome (deeper sequencing, relaxing alignment parameters), or possibly you have the wrong reference genome (meaning it is not similar enough to align the reads in your library against it).\n\n\n\n\nFellows Yates, James A, Dorothée G Drucker, Ella Reiter, Simon Heumos, Frido Welker, Susanne C Münzel, Piotr Wojtal, et al. 2017. “Central European Woolly Mammoth Population Dynamics: Insights from Late Pleistocene Mitochondrial Genomes.” Scientific Reports 7 (1): 17714. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-17723-1.\n\n\nWickham, Hadley, Mara Averick, Jennifer Bryan, Winston Chang, Lucy McGowan, Romain François, Garrett Grolemund, et al. 2019. “Welcome to the Tidyverse.” Journal of Open Source Software 4 (43): 1686. https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01686."
