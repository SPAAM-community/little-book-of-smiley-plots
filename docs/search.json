    "text": "Preface\nA key part of any ancient DNA project is to show that the DNA is exactly that - ancient. A key authentication method is to show the presence of elevated C to T deamination patterns (and the complementary G to A) at the end of DNA molecules, originally reported by (Briggs et al. 2007).\nThese patterns can be plotted in what have been colloquially known as ’Smiley Plots. However, there can be a wide range of smiley plots, some which show valid ancient DNA, and others that do not - either due to not actually having true ancient DNA but also from laboratory and/or bioinformatic artifacts.\nThis book aims\n\n\n\n\nBriggs, Adrian W, Udo Stenzel, Philip L F Johnson, Richard E Green, Janet Kelso, Kay Prüfer, Matthias Meyer, et al. 2007. “Patterns of Damage in Genomic DNA Sequences from a Neandertal.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 104 (37): 14616–21. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0704665104."

    "text": "How to generate damage patterns\nThere is a range of software that can generate damage pattern plots from ancient DNA NGS libraries. The vast majority of tools require to be of sequencing reads aligned to a reference genome. Here we make suggestions of some tools that you can use to generate such plots.\n\nGenomics\nThese tools general take BAM files as input (i.e., after mapping of FASTQ files to a reference genome using a short-read aligner )\n\nmapDamage\n\nSource: https://github.com/ginolhac/mapDamagee\nDocumentation: https://ginolhac.github.io/mapDamage\nCitation: (Jónsson et al. 2013)\n\nDamageProfiler\n\nSource: https://github.com/Integrative-Transcriptomics/DamageProfiler\nDocumentation: https://damageprofiler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\nCitation: (Neukamm, Peltzer, and Nieselt 2021)\n\n\n\n\nMetagenomics\n\nMaltExtract\n\nSource: https://github.com/rhuebler/MaltExtract\nDocumentation: https://github.com/rhuebler/MaltExtract\nCitation: (Hübler et al. 2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHübler, Ron, Felix M Key, Christina Warinner, Kirsten I Bos, Johannes Krause, and Alexander Herbig. 2019. “HOPS: Automated Detection and Authentication of Pathogen DNA in Archaeological Remains.” Genome Biology 20 (1): 280. https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1903-0.\n\n\nJónsson, Hákon, Aurélien Ginolhac, Mikkel Schubert, Philip L F Johnson, and Ludovic Orlando. 2013. “mapDamage2.0: Fast Approximate Bayesian Estimates of Ancient DNA Damage Parameters.” Bioinformatics 29 (13): 1682–84. https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt193.\n\n\nNeukamm, Judith, Alexander Peltzer, and Kay Nieselt. 2021. “DamageProfiler: Fast Damage Pattern Calculation for Ancient DNA.” Bioinformatics 37 (20): 3652–53. https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab190."
